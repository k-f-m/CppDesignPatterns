# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Some real-world examples of the Abstract Factory pattern:

- A GUI toolkit that supports multiple look-and-feels could use an abstract factory to provide a way to create a family of look-and-feel-specific components.
- A game development framework could use an abstract factory to create different types of enemies.
- A database driver could use an abstract factory to create different types of connections.
