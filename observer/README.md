# Observer

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows us to define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects of any events that happen to the object they're observing [1].

The observer is a common pattern in C++ code, especially in GUI components [2]. It provides a way to react to events that occur in other objects without having to couple to their classes.
