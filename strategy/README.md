# Strategy

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an algorithm to be selected at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

The Strategy pattern allows us to change the behavior of an object at runtime without changing the class that owns it. It encourages code reuse by providing a common interface for related algorithms, and makes it easy to add new algorithms without modifying existing code.
