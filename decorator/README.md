# Decorator

Decorator is a structural design pattern that allows us to dynamically add new behaviors to objects by placing them inside special wrapper objects called decorators [1].

Since both target objects and decorators follow the same interface, we can use decorators to wrap objects an infinite number of times [1]. The resulting object gets the stacking behavior of all wrappers.
