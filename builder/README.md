# Builder Pattern
The builder pattern is a creational design pattern that enables us construct complex objects step by step. 
The pattern lets us produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
 
The builder pattern generally involves three main components:
- The Builder interface: This interface defines all possible construction steps and provides methods for getting the final result.
- The Concrete Builder: This class implements the Builder interface and provides specific implementations of the construction steps.
- The Director (optional): This class is responsible for managing the construction process and calling the appropriate methods on the builder.

The builder pattern is useful when we need to create complex objects with many optional parameters or when we want to reuse the same construction code to produce different representations of an object.
