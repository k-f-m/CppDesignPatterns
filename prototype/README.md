# Prototype

Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows objects, even complex ones, to be cloned without coupling to their specific classes [1].

All prototype classes should have a common interface that allows objects to be copied even if their concrete classes are unknown [1]. Prototype objects can produce complete copies because objects of the same class can access each other's private fields.
