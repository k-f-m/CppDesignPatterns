# Adapter

The Adapter design pattern is used when you want to use an existing class, but its interface is incompatible with the rest of your code. The Adapter pattern allows you to create a new class that can communicate with the existing class by implementing the interface that your code expects. This way you can use the existing class without the need for modification.

A real-world example of the Adapter design pattern is when you want to use a third-party library in your code, but its interface is incompatible with your code. You can create an adapter class that implements the interface that your code expects and uses the third-party library internally. This way, you will be able to use the library without having to modify it.
