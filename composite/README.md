# Composite

Composite is a structural design pattern that allows you to assemble objects into a tree-like structure and work with it as if it were a single object [1].

Composite is a fairly popular solution to most problems that require building a tree structure. Composite's great feature is the ability to run methods recursively over the entire tree structure and sum the results [1].

- Usage example: In C++, the Composite pattern is often used to represent hierarchies of user interface components or code that works with graphs [1].
