# Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified but constrained interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework [1]. 

While Facade reduces the overall complexity of our application, it also helps to move unwanted dependencies into one place. It's particularly useful when working with complex libraries and APIs [1].
